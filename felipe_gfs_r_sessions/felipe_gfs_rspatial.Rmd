## Day one, 2 April 2020

First R session

1. Make and format maps
2. density maps
3. extract data from a raster
4. Combine and make calculations from multiple rasters                                                                                     
## Assumptions
we know what a CRS is, a projection is, how to prepare your files before an analysis
*reprojecting data is better in GIS than in R

So here he already prepared all the layers

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## types of data

vector: c() means vector. a group of different elements
dataframe: can have different columns of different types of elements
list: collection of multiple objects that you can call independently 
  (e.g multiple dataframes in a list, or a list of shapefiles, or list of rasters)

## split function

use this for large data, so you can apply a funciton to smaller bits of data

```{split}

data_sp <- split(data, data$spp_id) # will make a list, with one element for each of your spp_id

## convert shapefile to dataframe
map.df <- fortify(shapefile) # like making a sf objecti but simpler, just making a df from your shapefile

list[1] # calls the first element of your list

## or can only apply a funciton to certain elements of your list (eg certain species)
allplots <- lapply(data_sp[1:3], create_maps, map.df. onlypoints = TRUE) # create_maps is Felipe's function

```

## piles of map

```{stack}

# stack to import a raster stack, which is layers of rasters (so layers of different values or variables grouped together into a raster)
# different to a list of rasters - you'd use lapply for that. That's a collection of raster elements
```

## Day 2, 9 April 2020

# Intro to Loops

```{loops}

paste()
# when you want to concatenate numbers and letters into a sentence 
print(paste("we have session at", 9))
print(paste("we have session at", 10))
print(paste("we have session at", 11))
print(paste("we have session at", 12))
# this is annoying to copy and paste the different sessions with different numbers

## a loop is more efficient
# make a sequence of numbers
9:15
# now, concatenate each number in the sequence to the sentence and print it
for(hour in 9:15){
  print(paste("we have session at", hour))
}
# if you remove print, nothing happens
for(hour in 9:15){
  paste("we have session at", hour)
}
# so oyu need to store your result somewhere - first you have to create an empty object to store your results

# so here we create a list to store outputs (remember, a list is a list of objects, can be various types of objects)
list_of_sentences <- list()
for(hour in 9:15){
  list_of_sentences <- paste("we have session at", hour)
} # this overwrites each time and only stores the last sentence (with hour 15)

# so tell it to record all the results for each hour using the index []
list_of_sentences <- list()
for(hour in 9:15){
  list_of_sentences[[hour]] <- paste("we have session at", hour)
} # resturns the position of the sentence within the list in [[]]
list_of_sentences 

list_of_sentences <- list(1,2,3,4) # create list with 4 elements
# so you're telling it to store the results of your loop in those 4 positions

# NULL elements still get stored in teh list (so hours 1-8) get stored as HNULL, and you end up with 15 objects in your list

# so you can add things to your list at whatever position you want

## often see this as i

list_of_sentences <- list()
for(i in 1:15){ # for i in 1:15, 
  list_of_sentences[[i]] <- paste("we have session at", i) # do this loop and store it here
} 
list_of_sentences 

Reduce(list_of_sentences) # one way to remove any elements in the list that don't have anthing in them

```

## Day 4

random notes

sapply - makes a vector
lapply - makes a list. Can do the same thing as a loop
apply - for a dataframe 

When working with a big dataframe in R, the best thing you can do is split it
