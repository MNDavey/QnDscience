## Day one, 2 April 2020

First R session

1. Make and format maps
2. density maps
3. extract data from a raster
4. Combine and make calculations from multiple rasters                                                                                     
## Assumptions
we know what a CRS is, a projection is, how to prepare your files before an analysis
*reprojecting data is better in GIS than in R

So here he already prepared all the layers

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## types of data

vector: c() means vector. a group of different elements
dataframe: can have different columns of different types of elements
list: collection of multiple objects that you can call independently 
  (e.g multiple dataframes in a list, or a list of shapefiles, or list of rasters)

## split function

use this for large data, so you can apply a funciton to smaller bits of data

```{split}

data_sp <- split(data, data$spp_id) # will make a list, with one element for each of your spp_id

## convert shapefile to dataframe
map.df <- fortify(shapefile) # like making a sf objecti but simpler, just making a df from your shapefile

list[1] # calls the first element of your list

## or can only apply a funciton to certain elements of your list (eg certain species)
allplots <- lapply(data_sp[1:3], create_maps, map.df. onlypoints = TRUE) # create_maps is Felipe's function

```

## piles of map

```{stack}

# stack to import a raster stack, which is layers of rasters (so layers of different values or variables grouped together into a raster)
# different to a list of rasters - you'd use lapply for that. That's a collection of raster elements
```

## loops
